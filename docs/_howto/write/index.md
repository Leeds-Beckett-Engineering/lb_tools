# How To Use Technical and Academic Language Correctly

## Goals

Technical diagrams and drawing are a key tool in all fields of engineering, enabling you to accurately communicate complex ideas. All forms of technical drawing also have standards, some of which you can find in the [Reference section](). However many standards are also complemented by guidelines specific to the organisation you are working for: or working with. Thus the How To's in the _Table of Content_ section below cover both the universal and 'local' (Leeds Beckett) standards.

## General Principles

- [**The Metric System**](https://metricsystem.net). Covers the [fundamental units](https://metricsystem.net/si/base-units), [constants](https://metricsystem.net/si/defining-constants), [prefixes](https://metricsystem.net/prefixes/), and the most common [derived units](https://metricsystem.net/derived-units/special-names). There is also a useful [style guide](https://metricsystem.net/style-guide) which you should follow in all drawings.
