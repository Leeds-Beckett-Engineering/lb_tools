# Checklist for Submitting Code

## Background

Most modules will require some programming, you will often have to submit this code as part of an assessment. Even if you don't submit your code for an assessment, you will also need to make your own notes as you learn. This means it is important that your code is readable: both to others _and to you_. 

Remember that you will **read** code far more often than you will **write** it. So even for your own notes you need to be able to understand what your code is doing. Both now and in several months (or years) time when you come back to look at it.

This checklist summarises the _minimum_ you should check. You are strongly encouraged to develop your own checklist, or other notes, to help you build your own library of useful fragments, algorithms, and utilities. There are also specific checklists, tools, and utilities recommended for each language in the following subsections.

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] **File Headers**. Do all files have an explanation of what the file is for? Is the appropriate license in place, if required?
- [ ] **Structure Comments**. Do all classes, enumerations, functions, etc. have a clear comment outlining the parameters, use of the structure, corner cases, and other notes on appropriate use?
- [ ] **Code Comments**. Are all algorithms and data-structures appropriately commented: ideally with references? Are corner cases, missing data, stub-code and other elements the reader needs to pay attention to noted?
- [ ] **Code Formatting**. Is the code formatted appropriately, ideally using a tool or standard guide?
- [ ] **Code Linting**. Does the code meet guidelines for readability? Are the language elements chosen appropriate (for example, to check for depreciated usage)?
- [ ] **Test Cases**. Are appropriate unit, functional and integration tests included?
