# Obsolete Standards

## Overview

Electronic, and especially electrical, engineering have a long history: and during that time different standards have been in use. Once a body introduces a standard, it is remarkably hard to withdraw it from common use. And even if a standard is withdrawn, older documentation and technical writing still exists and remains useful. 

You _should not_ therefore use the standards in this section for new projects. However they remain here as a guide, and translation, between previously common standard and those you should now be using.
