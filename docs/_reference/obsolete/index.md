# Obsolete Standards

## Overview

Electronic, and especially electrical, engineering have a long history: and during that time different standards have been in use. Once a standard has been introduced, it is surprisingly hard to withdraw from common use. And even if a standard is withdrawn, older documentation and technical writing still exists and remains useful. 

The standards in this section therefore _should not_ be used in new writing and for new projects. However they remain here as a guide, and translation, between previously common standard and those you should now be using.
