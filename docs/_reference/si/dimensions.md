In general the _dimensional product_ forms the dimension of any quantity $$Q$$, as (The International System of Units (SI) (2019), pg. 136)

$$\dim\ Q = T^α L^β M^γ I^δ Θ^ε N^ζ J^η$$

where the exponents $$α$$, $$β$$, $$γ$$, $$δ$$, $$ε$$, $$ζ$$ and $$η$$, are often small integers. These exponents are the _dimensional exponents_ and can be positive, negative, or zero. Exponents which are zero are not usually used in the simplified form of the quantity dimension.

## Relating Quantity Values to Units

Any quantity $$Q$$ in SI relates to the numerical value $$\left\{ Q \right\}$$, and the unit $$\left[ Q \right]$$ by

$$Q = \left\{ Q \right\}\left[ Q \right]$$

The SI derived unit $$\left\{\text{Q}\right\}$$ of $$Q$$ is then obtained by replacing the dimensions of the SI base quantities. Therefore the dimension of $$Q$$, with the symbols for the corresponding traditional base units, is

$$\left\{\text{Q}\right\} = \left\{\text{m}^α\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{kg}^β\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{s}^γ\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{A}^δ\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{K}^ε\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{mol}^ζ\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{cd}^η\right\}$$

The exponents $$α \ldots η$$, are _dimensional exponents_. Dimensions which are not required in the definition of a specific unit have a zero value: other exponents give the number of dimensions required.

Where all dimension exponents are zero, as for ratios of quantities, the defined result of the dimension equation is

$$\left\{ Q \right\} = 1$$

$$\dim\ \text{Q} = 1$$

For example, the quantity value of velocity $$\nu$$ is physically defined by the relationship

$$\nu = \frac{l}{t}$$

where $$l$$ is the distance a particle in uniform motion with velocity $$\nu$$ travels in the time $$t$$. The dimension of $$l$$ is $$L$$, and thus the exponent $$\left\{ \text{m} ^ \alpha \right\}$$ is $$1$$. Likewise the dimension of $$t$$ is $$T$$, and hence the exponent $$\left\{\text{s}^γ\right\}$$ is $$-1$$. All other exponents are zero, and so the dimensional equation for $$\left\{ \nu \right\}$$ is

$$\left\{ \nu \right\} = \left\{\text{m}^1\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{kg}^0\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{s}^{-1}\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{A}^0\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{K}^0\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{mol}^0\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{cd}^0\right\}$$

$$\left\{ \nu \right\} = \left\{\text{m}^1\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{s}^{-1}\right\}$$

Hence the derived SI unit for $$\nu$$ is $$\text{m}^1\ \text{s}^{-1}$$.
