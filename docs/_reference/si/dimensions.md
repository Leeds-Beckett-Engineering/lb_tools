In general the _dimensional product_ forms the dimension of any quantity $$Q$$, as (The International System of Units (SI) (2019), pg. 136)

$$\dim\ Q = T^α L^β M^γ I^δ Θ^ε N^ζ J^η$$

where the exponents $$α$$, $$β$$, $$γ$$, $$δ$$, $$ε$$, $$ζ$$ and $$η$$, are often small integers. These exponents are the _dimensional exponents_ and can be positive, negative, or zero. Exponents which are zero are not usually used in the simplified form of the quantity dimension.

## Relating Quantity Values to Units

The SI derived unit $$\left\{\text{Q}\right\}$$ of $$Q$$ is 

$$\left\{\text{Q}\right\} = \left\{\text{m}^α\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{kg}^β\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{s}^γ\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{A}^δ\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{K}^ε\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{mol}^ζ\right\} \cdot \left\{\text{cd}^η\right\}$$

which is obtained by replacing the dimensions of the SI base quantities in the dimension of Q with the symbols for the corresponding traditional base units.
