# Oscilloscopes 

We have three main types of oscilloscopes in the labs and at the Helpdesk

1. Older style stand-alone Rigol 'scopes, which do not have an integrated function generator or signal decoders. These are available from the Helpdesk.
2. Stand-alone touchscreen 'scopes by Tektronic, which also have an integrated signal generator. Those in JG 110 have two input chanel's, with more sophisticated four-chanel versions available from the Helpdesk.
3. PicoScopes which require a Widows, Linux or MacOS machine to use. Versions with four chanel's and signal generators are in the main engineering labs: with older two-chanel 'scopes available at the Helpdesk.
