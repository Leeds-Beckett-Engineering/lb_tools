# Using the Leeds Beckett Pico Development Board

You will use the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2024) platform, and the RP2040, microcontroller extensively in modules across the different courses and years. This section gathers the tutorials for programming these microcontrollers: and especially programs using the Leeds Beckett development board.

Once you have completed these tutorials, or related tutorials in the modules, the [How To Guides]({{ site.baseurl }}/howto/pico/vs_code_python.html) cover common development tasks. This site also holds the [reference material]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/datasheets/pico.html) for the Pico and the RP2024 microcontroller.
